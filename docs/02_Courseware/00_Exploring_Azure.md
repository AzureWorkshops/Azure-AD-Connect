## Objective
You have just created a lab environment in Azure.  The lab environment is intended to mimic a basic, on-premises datacenter.  This datacenter, being extremely basic, consists of a single Active Directory domain controller and a utility machine.

The first objective is for you to become familiar with connecting to and navigating the Azure portal.  We will also explore the components in our virtual "datacenter" that the CLI created for us.  Finally, we will connect to our remote datacenter.

## Azure Portal Basics
Let's start by connecting to the Azure portal and becoming familiar with navigation.

  1. Open a browser and navigate to [http://www.azure.com](http://www.azure.com).

  2. In the top-right corner of your screen, you will see the menu option **PORTAL**. Click on it.
  
  3. If you have not already, you will be required to authenticate.
  
  4. After authentication is successful, you will be directed to your _Dashboard_. The dashboard is configurable by adding, removing and resizing _tiles_.  Additionally, you can have multiple dashboards depending on your preferences.  You could have different dashboards for resources dedicated to different functions, lines of business, or for operations.

  5. On the left will be your primary navigational menu. You should see a list of favorited services on the menu with descriptions.  (NOTE: The size of your menu may differ from that of others depending on the number of services you have selected as a favorite.) If all you see are icons (no descriptions) on your menu, your menu is currently collapsed.  Click the "hamburger" <img src="../images/hamburger.jpg" style="display: inline; margin:0px 5px;"/> to expand it. 

  6. Pretty close to the top of your menu, you should see **Resource Groups** <img src="../images/resource_groups_icon.jpg" style="display: inline; margin:0px 5px;"/>. Click this option.
